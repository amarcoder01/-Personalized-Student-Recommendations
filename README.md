## Overview

The Personalized Student Recommendations System leverages quiz data to:
1. Analyze student performance trends.
2. Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to enhance preparation.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Understand student performance by topic, difficulty level, and response accuracy.
- **Insight Generation**: Identify weak areas and improvement trends.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest focus areas for better results.
- **Student Persona Analysis**: Categorize students based on their strengths and weaknesses.

## Approach Description

### Step 1: Data Analysis
- Analyzed historical and current quiz data to extract meaningful insights.
- Categorized questions by difficulty and topic for focused recommendations.

### Step 2: Insight Generation
- Identified weak areas by analyzing incorrect responses and low-scoring topics.
- Visualized trends in improvement across quizzes.

### Step 3: Recommendations
- Suggested topics, question types, and difficulty levels for the student to prioritize.

### Step 4: API Implementation
- Built a Flask-based API to handle quiz data inputs and generate personalized recommendations dynamically.

## Usage

1. Upload quiz data (`historical_data.csv` and `current_quiz_data.csv`) to the `data/` folder.
2. Start the API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Use the endpoint `/recommend` to get recommendations based on quiz performance.

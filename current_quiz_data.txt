This free surface may face either a body fluid (such as blood, lymph, or mucus) or the outside environment.\n\nCharacteristics of Epithelial Tissue:\n\n *Free Surface:* The cells have an exposed surface that faces either a body fluid or the external environment.\n* *Apical Surface:* The surface facing the external environment or body cavity.\n* *Basal Surface:* The surface attached to the connective tissue below.\n* *Closely Packed:* The cells are closely packed together with minimal intercellular space.\n* *Polarized Cells:* They are generally polarized, with different apical and basal surfaces and functions.\n* *Basement Membrane:* The basal surface is supported by a basement membrane, which separates the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue.\n* *Avascular:* Epithelial cells are avascular, meaning they lack blood vessels. They receive nutrients from the underlying connective tissue through diffusion.\n\n*Functions of Epithelial Tissue:\n\n *Protection:* Forms a physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, and physical damage.\n* *Secretion:* Secretes various substances, such as mucus, enzymes, and hormones.\n* *Absorption:* Facilitates the uptake of substances from the external environment or body fluids.\n* *Excretion:* Helps eliminate waste products from the body.\n* *Sensory:* Contains specialized cells that detect changes in the environment and transmit sensory information.\n\n*Additional Context:\n\nEpithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function. Some of the common types include:\n\n *Simple Epithelium:* Consists of a single layer of cells.\n* *Stratified Epithelium:* Consists of multiple layers of cells.\n* *Glandular Epithelium:* Specialized for secretion of substances.\n* *Sensory Epithelium:* Contains specialized sensory cells.","type":"","is_mandatory":false,"show_in_feed":false,"pyq_label":null,"topic_id":146,"reading_material_id":2016
